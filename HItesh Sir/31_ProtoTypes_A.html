 // 💎✅💎 JAVASCRIPT is basically "prototypal" in behaviour (i.e. JS don't give up that easily , if it's not able to find something then it goes further up... further deep to find it out )
 // 💎✅💎 in JAVASCRIPT  basically everything is "OBJECT" either it be an ARRAY, STRING, FUNCTION  etc. 


 //💎💎 Creating an OBJECT 👇👇
    let a = {
        name: "Rishabh",
        langunage: "Hindi"
    }
    console.log(a);   // [📍📍 We have its prototypes in "console.log" of browser ]



 //💎💎  Accessing PROTOTYPE properties👇👇

    console.log(a.toString().length);   //  [📍📍 ANswer is "15"]
    console.log(a.hasOwnProperty());    //  [📍📍 ANswer is "false"]



 //💎💎  Inserting new PROTOTYPE properties in an object 👇👇

 let newProto = {
    run: () => {
        alert("run")
        },

    print : console.log("Hello Everyone")
 }

 a.__proto__ = newProto     // [📍📍 Inserting "newProto" property inside Object "a" ]
 a.run()                    // [📍📍 Answer:- We got alert of "run" & "Hello Everyone"  Printed in console]




 //💎💎  PROTOTYPE inside a PROTOTYPE 👇👇

 newProto.__proto__ = {         // [📍📍 Inserting new ProtoType property inside previously declared object "newProto" ]
    Naam: "Suresh",
    Bhaasha: "Malyalam"
 }

 console.log(a.Bhaasha);      // [📍📍Will get "Malyalam" printed in the console]
 
 /* ✅✅ in the above "console.log" statement first it will search for 
 "Bhaasha" in object "a" when not found >>> it went to prototype properties 
 of "a" (which inclues "newProto" property also) when not found >>> it went
 to the prototype property of "newProto" to find that
