// 💎✅💎  PROBLEM with "var" type variable 👇👇

var c = 300

if (true) {
    let a = 10
    const b = 20
    var c =20
    d = 40
}

// console.log(a);    // 📍Answer will not be printed bcoz "a" is not accesible outside scope
// console.log(b);    // 📍Answer will not be printed bcoz "b" is not accesible outside scope
// console.log(c);    // 📍 🚩🚩{Problem with VAR}🚩🚩 Answer will not be "30" [which should not be, as variable "var c" is definded in a SCOPE]
// console.log(d);    // 📍 🚩🚩{this kind of variable is also a problem}🚩🚩 Answer will not be "40" [which should not be, as this variable is definded in an SCOPE]

is called GLOBAL- SCOPE

// NESTED-SCOPE [SCOPE EXAMPLE WITH "FUNCTION inside a FUNCTION"] 👇👇

function one() {
    const username = "Rishabh"

    function two () {
        const website = "youtube"
        console.log(username);
    }

    // console.log(website);   // 📍Answer will not be "error" bcoz it won't get executed as variable "website" is inside the above scope

    // two()
}

    // one()  // 📍No answer will print bcoz function "one()" is only having "two()" to execute




    

//📍 SCOPE EXAMPLE WITH "IF - ELSE" STATEMENTS 👇👇


if (true) {
    const username = "Rishabh"
    if(username === "Rishabh") {
        const website = " youtube"
        // console.log(username+website);  // 📍Answer will be "Rishabh youtube"
    }
    // console.log(website);   // 📍Answer will be ERROR bcoz "variable website" is limited to above SCOPE
}
// console.log(username);   // 📍Answer will be ERROR bcoz "variable username" is limited to above SCOPE

// 📍Method - 1 [of declaring a function] 👇

// console.log(addone(5));      // 📍📍📍Answer will be "6" [bcoz below it we have just declared a simple function]

function addone (num) {
    return num + 1
}




// 📍Method - 2 [of declaring a function] 👇

// console.log(addTwo(5))        // 📍Answer will be "ERROR"  [bcoz below it, we have not only declared that function but we have also holded it inside a "VARIABLE"]

const addTwo = function (num) {
    return num + 2
}




function addThree (num) {
    let output = num + 1;
    let finalOutput = console.log(output);
    return finalOutput;
}

addThree(5)         // 📍Answer will be "6"
