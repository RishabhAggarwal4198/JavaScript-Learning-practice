/* ✅ When we add 'Async' keyword in front of Function, it automatically/ bydefault returns a PROMISE....
	& whatever function these PROMISE retunrs, upon that we could apply our functions like :- 'then' & 'catch'
*/ 



// 💎✅💎Creating ASYNC function 👇👇

async function greet() {
  return 'hello';
}

//📍📍Now when we will RUN 'greet()' in the console we will get :-
						 // Promise {<fulfilled>: 'hello'}
					     // [[Prototype]]: Promise
						 // [[PromiseState]]: "fulfilled"
						 // [[PromiseResult]]: "hello"

//✅ its returning [[PromiseState]]: "fulfilled" , even though we havn't even written any promise statement into it, but still returning the same
//✅ So basically the STRING 'hello' which we have wrote after 'return' , it's making a result & it's getting stored in the PROMISE
