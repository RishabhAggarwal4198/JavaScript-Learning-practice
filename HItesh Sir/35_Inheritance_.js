// 💎✅💎 Now suppose we are making any website like E-commerce or Shopping so we also have to make this "Userrzz" as ADMIN, TEACHER, STUDENT

class Teacher extends Userrzz {                    // 💎🍁✅🍁💎 So in in functions previously as we used to use ".prototype" keyword to add any new "PROTOTYPE-property" to the function, Similarly in CLASSES here we have "extends" keyword to add or kind of extend the "PROTOTYPE" properties of that particular class
    constructor (username, email, password) {
        super(username)                           //[@8:25:43] [💎🍁✅🍁💎Using "super(username)" here will directly contact to the name of the class written after "extedds" & will call it, which in this case is "extends User"  ] 
        this.email = email
        this.password = password
    }
