// 💎💎 Creating a PROMISE 👇👇

const PromiseOne = new Promise (function(resolve, reject){     // [📍📍 in our daily world a PROMISE done by someone will only have two aspects 1) Either it will be completed 2) Or it will not get completed, So Similarly in JS also PROMISE have two aspects "resolve" & "rejected"]

    // Do an Async task :-
    // + DB calls
    // + Cryptography
    // + Network


    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log('ASync task is complete');
    },1000)
    
})
